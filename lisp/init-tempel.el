  ;; `tempel-expand' only triggers on exact matches. Alternatively use
  ;; `tempel-complete' if you want to see all matches, but then you
  ;; should also configure `tempel-trigger-prefix', such that Tempel
  ;; does not trigger too often when you don't expect it. NOTE: We add
  ;; `tempel-expand' *before* the main programming mode Capf, such
  ;; that it will be tried first.
